# Workshop #1 Take-Home Level 2: Basic Counter with Javascript

Your goal for this takehome assignment is to create a counter using basic Javascript. We have provided you with some starter code in the `index.html` and `src/index.js` files to help you get started.

### Ideally, your final counter webpage should have the following:
* Two buttons that increase and decrease the count when clicked
* A count display that updates every time a button is clicked

## Challenges
If you want to do more with this assignment, here are a few suggestions for modifications/additions you can make to your counter:
* A reset button that sets the count to zero when clicked
* Make the buttons change color while they are being clicked (e.g. the '+' button turns green, the '-' button turns red)
* Make the display change color when it changes signs (e.g. red when negative, green when positive, black when 0)

Also feel free to modify the `styles.css` file provided in the `src` folder if you wish to make your counter look nicer.
